Shri Ram, also known as Lord Rama, is one of the most revered deities in Hinduism. He is believed to be the seventh avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu, who is considered one of the primary gods in the Hindu pantheon.
Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya, India, more than 7,000 years ago. According to Hindu mythology, his birth was prophesied to bring about the end of evil and restore righteousness to the world. His childhood was filled with many extraordinary events, and he is often depicted as an obedient and virtuous child.
As an adult, Shri Ram became a great king and warrior. He is best known for his heroic exploits in the epic Hindu text, the Ramayana, which tells the story of his life and adventures. The Ramayana describes how Shri Ram defeated the demon king Ravana, who had kidnapped his wife Sita, and how he eventually returned to Ayodhya to reclaim his rightful place as king.
Shri Ram is also associated with many other important events in Hindu mythology, such as his exile to the forest with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshman, his friendship with the monkey-god Hanuman, and his coronation as king of Ayodhya.
Devotees of Shri Ram celebrate his birth anniversary, known as Ram Navami, with great devotion and enthusiasm. His teachings and stories continue to inspire millions of people around the world to this day, and he is revered as an embodiment of virtue, righteousness, and devotion to duty.
